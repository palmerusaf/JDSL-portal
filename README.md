# JDSL portal

## About

This project is a recreation of a codebase from a satirical (hopefully) [article](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-inner-json-effect) that uses a convoluted build tool known as JDSL.

## Usage

### Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/palmerusaf/JDSL-portal.git

```

### Running

```bash
cd JDSL-portal
./JDSL ./the_system

```

This will start both the API servers and the web server. To see it in action go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Quitting

To stop press CTRL+C in the terminal.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add sh that updates json with last commit
- [x] Add backend server in JDSL
- [x] Add frontend
- [x] Launch frontend and backend with JDSL
- [ ] Add new-hire branch that corrupts backend data
